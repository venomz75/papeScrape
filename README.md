#### papeScrape is a basic Python webscraper which downloads all of the images in a 4chan thread. As the name may suggest; the initial intention was to download wallpapers from it's [/wg/](http://boards.4chan.org/wg/catalog) board.

## Current features:
* NSFW boards are included or excluded depending on the user's choice
* Can choose any thread from any board
* All image, .webm, .pdf etc. files from a thread saved in it's own directory
* Saves OP's message in a .txt file in that same directory

## Planned changes:
* Add selection of threads by post number or topic.
* Add an image count to the threads.
* Add capability for multiple concurrent thread downloads.
* Add command based interaction with the program.
